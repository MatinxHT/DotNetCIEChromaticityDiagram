# CIEChromaticityDiagramDrawing
CIE chromaticity diagram drawing for .Net

This project is developed based on ZedGraph, but unfortunately ZedGraph only supports WinFroms (.NET Framework 4.7) and has stopped updating, so the original code is released for sharing and development.

At present, many projects on github that draw CIE1931 do not draw blackbody radiation curves. This project contains data related to radiation curves.

I hope that more people will participate in maintaining this project
